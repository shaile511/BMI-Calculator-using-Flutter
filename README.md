Ever wondered what your BMI is? Be it a Yes or No, here's an interesting application that helps you be updated with your BMI(Body Mass Index). Ignore all the mathematics involved in the calculation and enjoy an interactive cum attractive interface(I believe so) for calculating an important numerical figure concerning the fitness of a person. 


<b>How's it different from the already existing myriad of applications?</b>
Well, this has neumorphic design which enhances the look and feel of the application. Its interactive in a sense which provides motivational feedback on your BMI level. This consists of customized flutter widgets and the UI is inspired from the design posted by Ruben Vaalt.
